# Benefits of Static Sites

Static sites have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their numerous advantages over dynamic websites.

## Performance

Static sites load much faster than dynamic sites because they don't require server-side processing for each request.

## Security

Static sites are more secure because there's no database or server-side code to exploit.

## Reliability

Static sites are highly reliable as they don't depend on databases or server-side applications.

## Scalability

Static sites can easily handle high traffic volumes without additional server resources.

## Cost-Effectiveness

Hosting static sites is often cheaper than hosting dynamic sites, especially for high-traffic websites.
